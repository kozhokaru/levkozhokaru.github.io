                        <p>Security vulnerabilities can be costly if they make it to production‚Äîboth in terms of potential breaches and the resources required to fix them post-deployment. Traditional security reviews often happen too late in the development cycle, creating bottlenecks and increasing the cost of fixes. But what if you could catch these issues before they even reach code review?</p>

                        <p>Today, we're introducing new security-focused features that make defensive security a seamless part of your development workflow. These features help you identify and fix vulnerabilities early, when they're easiest and cheapest to address.</p>

                        <h2>Review code for vulnerabilities from your terminal</h2>
                        
                        <p>The new <code>/security-review</code> command lets you run ad-hoc security analyses from your terminal before committing code. Run the command in your IDE, and the AI will search your codebase for potential vulnerabilities and provide detailed explanations of any issues found.</p>

                        <p>This command uses a specialized security-focused prompt that checks for common vulnerability patterns including:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>SQL injection risks</li>
                            <li>Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities</li>
                            <li>Authentication and authorization flaws</li>
                            <li>Insecure data handling</li>
                            <li>Dependency vulnerabilities</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>You can also ask the AI to implement fixes for each issue after they're identified. This keeps security reviews in your inner development loop, catching issues early when they're easiest to fix.</p>

                        <h2>Automated security checks in CI/CD</h2>

                        <p>For teams that want consistent security coverage, you can now add automated security reviews to your CI/CD pipeline. This ensures every pull request gets a security review, regardless of who's coding or when they're working.</p>

                        <p>The integration works with popular CI/CD platforms and can be configured to:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li>Run on every pull request automatically</li>
                            <li>Check only modified files or the entire codebase</li>
                            <li>Block merges for critical vulnerabilities</li>
                            <li>Generate detailed security reports</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Setting up automated reviews</h3>

                        <p>Integration is straightforward. Here's an example GitHub Actions workflow:</p>

                        <pre><code>name: Security Review
on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  security-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run AI Security Review
        run: |
          ai-review --security \
            --severity high \
            --format markdown > security-report.md
      - name: Comment PR
        uses: actions/github-script@v6
        with:
          script: |
            const fs = require('fs');
            const report = fs.readFileSync('security-report.md', 'utf8');
            github.rest.issues.createComment({
              issue_number: context.issue.number,
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              body: report
            });</code></pre>

                        <h2>Real-world impact</h2>

                        <p>Early adopters of these features are already seeing significant improvements in their security posture:</p>

                        <blockquote>
                            "We caught a critical SQL injection vulnerability in a feature branch that would have made it to production. The AI not only identified it but provided the exact fix needed." - Engineering Lead at a fintech startup
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>Teams report finding an average of 3-5 security issues per week that would have otherwise made it through code review. More importantly, developers are learning from the AI's explanations, improving their security awareness over time.</p>

                        <h2>Security-first development culture</h2>

                        <p>These tools aren't just about finding bugs‚Äîthey're about building a security-first culture. When security reviews happen automatically and consistently, they become a natural part of development rather than a gate at the end.</p>

                        <p>Developers get immediate feedback on security issues, learning secure coding patterns through practical examples in their own code. Over time, this leads to fewer vulnerabilities being introduced in the first place.</p>

                        <h2>Getting started</h2>

                        <p>To start using security reviews in your development workflow:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Update to the latest version of the CLI tool</li>
                            <li>Run <code>/security-review</code> on your current branch to see it in action</li>
                            <li>Configure your CI/CD pipeline for automated reviews</li>
                            <li>Customize severity levels and vulnerability types to match your needs</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>The security review features are available now for all users. We recommend starting with manual reviews to get familiar with the tool, then gradually rolling out automated reviews across your team.</p>

                        <h2>What's next</h2>

                        <p>We're continuing to improve these security features based on user feedback. Upcoming enhancements include:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Custom security rules specific to your organization</li>
                            <li>Integration with existing security tools and scanners</li>
                            <li>Compliance checking for standards like OWASP Top 10</li>
                            <li>Security training mode for junior developers</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Security doesn't have to slow down development. With the right tools integrated into your workflow, you can ship faster and more securely than ever before.</p>
