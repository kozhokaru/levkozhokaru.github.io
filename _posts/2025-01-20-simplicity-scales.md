The best systems are boringly simple. They do one thing well and compose beautifully with others.

Complexity is a loan you take against your future self. Every abstraction, every dependency, every clever trick - they all have interest rates.

When faced with two solutions, choose the simpler one. Not because you're lazy, but because simple systems are easier to understand, debug, and extend.

Unix philosophy got it right: small, focused tools that work together. That scales. Monolithic complexity doesn't.
