Hardware is faster than ever, but users expect instant responses. Every millisecond counts when attention spans are measured in seconds.

Performance isn't just about speed - it's about perception. A loading spinner that appears instantly feels faster than a blank screen, even if the total time is the same.

Optimize the critical path first. What does the user see in the first 100ms? The first second? That's where you win or lose them.

Remember: performance is a feature. It directly impacts user satisfaction, conversion rates, and your bottom line.
