The best code reviews teach, share context, and build team consensus. Finding bugs is just a nice side effect.

When you review code, you're not just checking for errors. You're ensuring knowledge isn't siloed, standards are maintained, and junior developers learn from senior patterns.

Good reviewers ask questions, not give orders. "Have you considered..." beats "You should..." every time.

Remember: code review is a conversation, not an inspection. It's how teams grow together.
