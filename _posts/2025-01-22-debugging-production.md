When production breaks at 3 AM, you need more than just logs. You need a systematic approach to finding the root cause.

Start with the symptoms, not assumptions. What changed? When did it start? Is it affecting all users or just some?

The best debuggers think like detectives: gather evidence, form hypotheses, test them systematically. Don't guess - measure.

Tools are important, but methodology is crucial. A well-structured investigation beats random log diving every time.
